# Integrating Threat Intelligence into ASM

Incorporating threat intelligence increases the relevance and prioritization of ASM findings.

## Key Sources
- CVE feeds from NVD or Vulners
- Exploit DB and MITRE ATT&CK mappings
- RSS feeds from:
  - AlienVault OTX
  - AbuseIPDB
  - PhishTank

## Tools
- IntelOwl
- OpenCTI
- Yeti
- MISP

## Process
- Match IOCs against discovered assets
- Monitor for abuse or breach indicators
- Triage based on exploitability and relevance

This turns passive discovery into context-aware decision-making.
