# üöÄ Getting Started with ASM

Welcome to Attack Surface Management! This guide will take you from zero to running your first ASM scan in under 30 minutes.

## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A working ASM environment
- ‚úÖ Essential tools installed and configured
- ‚úÖ Completed your first domain assessment
- ‚úÖ Generated a professional security report
- ‚úÖ Understanding of next steps for continued learning

**‚è±Ô∏è Total Time Required:** 20-30 minutes

## üîç Quick Self-Assessment

**Are you ready for ASM?** Check all that apply:
- [ ] I can open a terminal/command prompt
- [ ] I understand what a domain name is (like google.com)
- [ ] I have a computer with internet access
- [ ] I want to learn about cybersecurity

**If you checked all boxes, you're ready to start!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Environment Setup (10 minutes)

### Option A: Quick Start (Recommended for Beginners)
Use our pre-configured Docker container:

```bash
# Pull and run the ASM toolkit container
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/results:/results \
  asmtoolkit/quickstart:latest

# You're now in a fully configured ASM environment!
```

### Option B: Manual Installation
If you prefer to install tools manually:

#### Install Go (Required for most tools)
```bash
# Linux/macOS
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# macOS with Homebrew
brew install go

# Windows
# Download installer from https://golang.org/dl/
```

#### Install Essential Tools
```bash
# Subdomain discovery
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest

# Web service discovery
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest

# Port scanning
sudo apt install nmap  # Linux
brew install nmap      # macOS

# Screenshots
go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest

# Verify installations
amass version && subfinder -version && httpx -version && nmap --version
```

## üéØ Step 2: Your First ASM Scan (10 minutes)

### Choose Your Target
**üö® CRITICAL AUTHORIZATION CHECK üö®**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING - ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS:**
1. Do you own this domain? **YES/NO**
2. Do you have written permission to scan this target? **YES/NO**
3. Have you verified this is not a third-party service? **YES/NO**
4. Are you aware of the legal implications in your jurisdiction? **YES/NO**

**If you answered NO to any question, STOP and get proper authorization first.**

**‚úÖ SAFE OPTIONS FOR LEARNING:**
- **Your own infrastructure:** Domains and servers you personally own
- **Authorized test targets:**
  - `scanme.nmap.org` (Nmap's official test target)
  - `testphp.vulnweb.com` (Acunetix test site)
  - `hack-yourself-first.com` (Troy Hunt's test site)
- **Local testing:** `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- **Your home network:** `192.168.1.0/24` (if you own the router)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER SCAN WITHOUT PERMISSION:**
- Corporate networks (unless you're authorized IT staff)
- Government websites
- Financial institutions
- Any domain you don't own
- Cloud services you don't control

### Run the Complete Workflow

```bash
# üö® AUTHORIZATION VERIFICATION SCRIPT üö®

### Understanding Your Results

```bash
# View discovered subdomains
echo "=== SUBDOMAINS DISCOVERED ==="
cat subdomains.txt

# View live web services
echo "=== LIVE WEB SERVICES ==="
cat live_hosts.txt

# View open ports
echo "=== OPEN PORTS ==="
grep "open" port_scan.txt

# View screenshots
echo "=== SCREENSHOTS ==="
ls -la screenshots/
```

## üìä Step 3: Generate Your First Report (5 minutes)

Create a simple HTML report of your findings:

```bash
# Generate basic HTML report
cat > asm_report.html << EOF
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>ASM Report for $TARGET</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 40px; }
        .section { margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; }
        .finding { background: #f8f9fa; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0; }
        .critical { border-left-color: #dc3545; }
        .warning { border-left-color: #ffc107; }
        .info { border-left-color: #17a2b8; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>ASM Report for $TARGET</h1>
    <p>Generated on: $(date)</p>
    
    <div class="section info">
        <h2>üìä Summary</h2>
        <div class="finding">

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've just completed your first ASM assessment! Here's what you accomplished:

### ‚úÖ What You Did
1. **Discovered hidden assets** - Found subdomains that might not be publicly known
2. **Identified live services** - Determined which services are actually running
3. **Mapped the attack surface** - Catalogued potential entry points
4. **Documented findings** - Created a professional report

### üîç What Your Results Mean

**Subdomains Found:** Each subdomain represents a potential attack vector. More subdomains = larger attack surface.

**Live Web Services:** These are actively running services that could contain vulnerabilities.

**Open Ports:** Each open port is a potential entry point. Common concerning ports:
- 22 (SSH) - Remote access
- 23 (Telnet) - Unencrypted remote access
- 3389 (RDP) - Windows remote desktop
- Database ports (3306, 5432, 1433) - Direct database access

**Screenshots:** Visual evidence of what's actually running on each service.

## üö® Critical Security and Legal Reminders

### ‚úÖ What You Should Do Next
1. **If this was your own domain:**
   - Review each finding for security implications
   - Ensure all services are intentionally exposed
   - Check for unnecessary open ports
   - Verify all subdomains are legitimate
   - Document any security improvements needed

2. **If you found concerning issues:**
   - Document everything with timestamps
   - Report to the appropriate security team
   - Follow responsible disclosure practices
   - Do NOT attempt to exploit vulnerabilities

3. **For learning purposes:**
   - Practice on authorized targets only
   - Join bug bounty programs for legal testing
   - Set up your own lab environment
   - Study the tools and techniques used

### ‚ùå What You Must NEVER Do
- **NEVER scan domains you don't own without explicit written permission**
- **NEVER attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities you find**
- **NEVER share sensitive findings publicly without permission**
- **NEVER ignore legal and ethical boundaries**
- **NEVER use these tools for malicious purposes**
- **NEVER assume "it's just reconnaissance" makes it legal**

### üö® Legal Warning
**Unauthorized scanning can result in:**
- Criminal charges under computer fraud laws
- Civil lawsuits for damages
- Permanent criminal record
- Loss of employment and security clearances
- Significant financial penalties

**When in doubt, DON'T scan. Get explicit written permission first.**

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Review your results** - Understand what each finding means
2. **Try a different target** - Scan another authorized domain
3. **Explore the tools** - Run individual commands to understand each tool

### Short-term Learning (Next week)
1. **üìñ [Complete Learning Guide](resources/learning_guide.md)** - Follow the structured curriculum
2. **üõ†Ô∏è [Tool Documentation](tools/)** - Deep dive into specific tools
3. **ü§ñ [Automation Scripts](scripts/)** - Learn to automate your workflows

### Long-term Development (Next month)
1. **üîß Build custom workflows** - Adapt tools to your specific needs
2. **üìä Implement monitoring** - Set up continuous asset discovery
3. **üéì Join the community** - Contribute and learn from others

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Command not found" errors:**
```bash
# Check if Go is installed
go version

# Check if tools are in PATH
echo $PATH | grep go

# Reinstall tools if needed
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
```

**"Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you have execute permissions
chmod +x /path/to/tool

# For nmap, you might need sudo
sudo nmap -sS target.com
```

**"No results found":**
```bash
# Verify target is reachable
ping target.com

# Try with a known working target
subfinder -d google.com
```

**Tools running slowly:**
```bash
# Reduce scan intensity
nmap -T2 target.com  # Slower but more polite
amass enum -passive -d target.com  # Passive only
```
