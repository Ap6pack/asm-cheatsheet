# ASM Cheatsheet Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach for expanding the ASM cheatsheet into a comprehensive, multi-tiered resource that serves users from beginners to advanced practitioners.

## 🎯 Vision

Transform the ASM cheatsheet into the **definitive ASM resource** by implementing three complementary tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Quick Reference - Immediate lookup and commands
- **Tier 2**: Practical Automation - Ready-to-use scripts and integrations
- **Tier 3**: Real-World Scenarios - Industry-specific guidance and playbooks
