# üß© Attack Surface Management (ASM) Cheat Sheet

A tactical, practical community reference for Attack Surface Management. This guide provides real-world advice, open-source tooling, and automation concepts for discovering, analyzing, and managing digital exposures.

## What is ASM?

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is the continuous discovery, monitoring, prioritization, and tracking of internal and external digital assets that could be attacked. This includes unknown, unmanaged, third-party, and ephemeral systems.

Goal: Identify unknown assets, reduce blind spots, and detect risky changes quickly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into ASM, ensure you have:

**Technical Skills:**
- Basic command line familiarity (Linux/macOS terminal or Windows PowerShell)
- Understanding of networking fundamentals (DNS, IP addresses, ports, HTTP/HTTPS)
- Basic scripting knowledge (bash/python helpful but not required)

**Required Tools:**
- Git for cloning tool repositories
- Python 3.7+ and pip package manager
- Virtual machine or isolated testing environment (recommended)
- Text editor or IDE for configuration files

**API Keys (Optional but Recommended):**
- [Shodan API key](https://account.shodan.io/) for internet-wide scanning
- [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for repository searches
- [VirusTotal API key](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) for threat intelligence

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Only scan assets you own or have explicit permission to test.**

- **Scope Definition:** Clearly define what you're authorized to scan
- **Rate Limiting:** Use reasonable delays between requests to avoid overwhelming targets
- **Responsible Disclosure:** Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **Legal Compliance:** Understand local laws regarding security testing

### üéØ Your First ASM Scan (5-minute walkthrough)

**üìñ New to ASM? Start with our [Complete Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for a comprehensive 30-minute walkthrough!**

#### Step 1: Install Basic Tools
```bash
# Install Amass for subdomain discovery
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master

# Install httpx for web service discovery
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest

# Alternative: Use package managers
sudo apt install amass  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install amass      # macOS
```

#### Step 2: Discover Subdomains (Passive)
```bash
# Replace 'example.com' with a domain you own
amass enum -passive -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
```

#### Step 3: Find Live Web Services
```bash
# Check which subdomains have web services
httpx -l subdomains.txt -o live_hosts.txt
```

#### Step 4: Take Screenshots
```bash
# Install and use gowitness for visual reconnaissance
go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest
gowitness file -f live_hosts.txt
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Starter Toolkit

| Tool | Purpose | Difficulty | Installation |
|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Amass | Subdomain discovery | Beginner | `go install github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master` |
| httpx | Web service probing | Beginner | `go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest` |
| nmap | Port scanning | Beginner | `sudo apt install nmap` or `brew install nmap` |
| gowitness | Screenshots | Beginner | `go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest` |
| Shodan CLI | Internet scanning | Intermediate | `pip install shodan` |

### üö® Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Problem:** "I'm getting blocked or rate limited"
- **Solution:** Add delays between requests (`--delay` flags), use rotating proxies, or reduce scan intensity

**Problem:** "Too many false positives in results"
- **Solution:** Filter results by response codes, content length, or known patterns

**Problem:** "Don't know what to scan first"
- **Solution:** Start with certificate transparency logs and passive DNS for your known domains

**Problem:** "Tools won't install or run"
- **Solution:** Use Docker containers or pre-built VMs like Kali Linux

### üéØ Safe Practice Targets

- **Your own infrastructure:** Domains and IPs you control
- **Bug bounty programs:** Check [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/) and [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/) for in-scope targets
- **Intentionally vulnerable apps:** [DVWA](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/), [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/)
- **Test domains:** Use `testphp.vulnweb.com` or similar designated test sites
