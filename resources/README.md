## ASM Terminology Glossary

### Core Concepts

**Attack Surface:** The sum of all possible attack vectors where an unauthorized user can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment.

**Asset Discovery:** The process of identifying all digital assets (domains, IPs, services, applications) that belong to an organization.

**Certificate Transparency (CT):** Public logs of SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to discover subdomains and services.

**Digital Risk:** Potential threats to an organization's digital assets, including data breaches, service disruptions, and reputation damage.

**External Attack Surface:** Assets that are accessible from the internet and potentially visible to attackers.

**Shadow IT:** IT systems, devices, software, applications, and services outside the ownership or control of IT organizations.

**Subdomain Enumeration:** The process of finding subdomains of a target domain using various techniques.

**Threat Intelligence:** Evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging threats that can inform security decisions.

### Technical Terms

**Banner Grabbing:** Technique used to gather information about services running on networked computers.

**DNS Enumeration:** Process of locating all DNS servers and their corresponding records for an organization.

**Fingerprinting:** Identifying the specific software, version, and configuration of network services.

**OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):** Intelligence collected from publicly available sources.

**Passive Reconnaissance:** Information gathering without directly interacting with the target system.

**Port Scanning:** Technique to discover open ports and services on a network host.

**Service Enumeration:** Process of identifying services running on discovered ports.

**Web Crawling:** Automated browsing of websites to discover pages and functionality.
