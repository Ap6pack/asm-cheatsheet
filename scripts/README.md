## Available Scripts

### üîç basic_asm_scan.sh
**Purpose:** Complete ASM workflow automation  
**Usage:** `./basic_asm_scan.sh domain.com`

**What it does:**
1. Discovers subdomains using Amass (passive)
2. Finds live web services with httpx
3. Performs basic port scanning with nmap
4. Takes screenshots with gowitness
5. Organizes results in timestamped directory

**Requirements:**
- amass
- httpx
- nmap
- gowitness

**Example:**
```bash
chmod +x basic_asm_scan.sh
./basic_asm_scan.sh example.com
```

### üìä monitor_changes.py
**Purpose:** Website change detection and monitoring  
**Usage:** `python3 monitor_changes.py urls.txt`

**What it does:**
1. Monitors websites for content changes
2. Maintains baseline hashes
3. Detects and reports differences
4. Tracks content length changes

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- requests library (`pip install requests`)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create URLs file
echo "https://example.com" > urls.txt
echo "https://api.example.com/status" >> urls.txt

# Run monitoring
python3 monitor_changes.py urls.txt

# Schedule with cron for continuous monitoring
# Add to crontab: 0 */6 * * * /path/to/monitor_changes.py /path/to/urls.txt
```

## Installation Guide

### Quick Setup (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install Go tools
go install github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest

# Install system tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap python3 python3-pip

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install requests
```

### Quick Setup (macOS)
```bash
# Install Go tools (same as above)
go install github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest

# Install system tools
brew install nmap python3

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install requests
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Domain Assessment
```bash
# Run complete scan
./basic_asm_scan.sh target.com

# Results will be in: asm_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

### Continuous Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Create monitoring list
cat > monitor_urls.txt << EOF
https://company.com
https://app.company.com
https://api.company.com
https://admin.company.com
EOF

# Initial baseline
python3 monitor_changes.py monitor_urls.txt

# Set up daily monitoring (add to crontab)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/asm-cheatsheet/scripts && python3 monitor_changes.py monitor_urls.txt
```

### Integration with Existing Workflows
```bash
# Use with existing subdomain lists
httpx -l existing_subdomains.txt -o live_hosts.txt
gowitness file -f live_hosts.txt

# Monitor specific endpoints
echo "https://target.com/admin" > critical_urls.txt
python3 monitor_changes.py critical_urls.txt critical_baseline.json critical_changes.json
```

## Security Considerations

- **Rate Limiting:** Scripts include delays to avoid overwhelming targets
- **User Agents:** Identify your scans appropriately
- **Scope:** Only scan domains you own or have permission to test
- **Logging:** Monitor script execution and results for anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found" errors:**
- Ensure Go tools are in your PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
- Verify installations: `which amass httpx gowitness nmap`

**Permission denied:**
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh *.py`
- Run nmap with sudo if needed for SYN scans

**Python import errors:**
- Install requests: `pip3 install requests`
- Use virtual environment if needed

**No results found:**
- Check domain spelling and DNS resolution
- Verify network connectivity
- Try with known working domains first

## Advanced Usage

### Integration with Workflows

These scripts are designed to work with the workflows described in [Practical Workflows](../examples/practical_workflows.md):

- **New Domain Assessment** - Use `basic_asm_scan.sh` for initial discovery
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Use `monitor_changes.py` for ongoing surveillance
- **Incident Response** - Rapid asset discovery during security incidents
- **Bug Bounty Reconnaissance** - Efficient target enumeration

### Enterprise Deployment

For enterprise use, consider:

1. **Containerization** - Deploy scripts in Docker containers
2. **Orchestration** - Use Kubernetes for scale
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Automate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
4. **Monitoring** - Integrate with SIEM and alerting systems

See our [Case Studies](../examples/case_studies.md) for real-world enterprise implementations.

### Security Best Practices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always follow our [Security Considerations](../resources/security_considerations.md):

- Only scan assets you own or have explicit permission to test
- Implement proper rate limiting to avoid overwhelming targets
- Use secure credential management for API keys
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any findings

## Contributing

We welcome script contributions! See our [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information.

### Script Contribution Guidelines

1. **Follow naming convention**: `purpose_description.ext`
2. **Include comprehensive documentation** with usage examples
3. **Implement proper error handling** and logging
4. **Add security considerations** and rate limiting
5. **Test with safe targets** before submitting
6. **Update this README** with your script documentation

### High-Priority Script Needs

- **Cloud asset enumeration** automation
- **Threat intelligence integration** scripts
- **Report generation** and visualization tools
- **Multi-tool orchestration** frameworks
- **Compliance checking** automation

### Testing Requirements

All scripts must be tested with:
- Valid inputs and expected scenarios
- Invalid inputs and error conditions
- Rate limiting and timeout scenarios
- Different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Various network conditions

For detailed testing guidelines, see our [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-standards).
